# Custom Sioyek Configuration

This configuration extends the default Sioyek setup with several useful features for efficient PDF navigation and theming.

## Features

- **Theme Switching** — Instantly toggle between whole themes using <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>1–9</kbd>.  
- **File Navigation** — Move left with <kbd>D</kbd> or right with <kbd>L</kbd> between PDF files in the current directory sorted alphanumerically for quick browsing.  
- **Directory Switching** — Jump to the directory of the currently opened file with <kbd>u</kbd>, making it easy to access related PDFs.

> Ensure that `$CONFIG_DIR` is set to your configuration directory, and that this folder is located inside it (e.g., `~/.config/sioyek`).
